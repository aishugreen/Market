# Global EUV Lithography Market Size, Share, Growth, Demand 2024-2030

The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography market is at the forefront of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, representing a key technology for producing advanced microchips with ever-smaller feature sizes. EUV lithography utilizes light with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, which is significantly shorter than the deep ultraviolet (DUV) light traditionally used in photolithography. This shorter wavelength allows for the creation of finer patterns on silicon wafers, enabling the production of microchips with higher transistor densities and improved performance.
